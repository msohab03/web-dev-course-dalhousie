        <h2>History of Mos Eisley</h2>
        <p>Mos Eisley was a spaceport on the desert planet of Tatooine. It was located on the Great Mesra Plateau
            , north of Anchorhead, and southeast of the Jundland Wastes. The spaceport, while lacking a primary landing 
            facility, contained 362 hangars in which arrivals could berth. The city had wide, sandy streets and many buildings 
            of various sizes. Mos Eisley was home to various species of aliens from throughout the galaxy.</p>
        <p>Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina was where Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi met Han Solo and Chewbacca, during their 
            attempts to reach Alderaan and deliver the Death Star plans to the Rebel Alliance. Imperial stormtroopers also 
            searched Mos Eisley for R2-D2 and C-3PO, the holders of the missing Death Star plans. The cantina was also home 
            to the infamous confrontation between Han Solo and Greedo, which led to Greedo's untimely death. Ponda Baba and 
            Dr. Cornelius Evazan were present at Mos Eisley, and Obi-Wan Kenobi cut off Ponda Baba's right arm with his lightsaber.</p>
        <p>When Boba Fett was hired by Darth Vader to find information on the pilot who destroyed the Death Star, Fett went to 
            the cantina in search of information, knowing that Han Solo had frequented it. He learned the pilot's name, from 
            a young moisture farmer, was Luke Skywalker, and went in search of him, encountering him in the home of Obi-Wan Kenobi.</p>
        <p>The city celebrated the destruction of the second Death Star and the death of the emperor. 
            Sometime after the fall of the Empire, Boba Fett visited the city to meet with a Pyke boss in the 
            Desert Survey Office. In 9 ABY, the bounty hunter Din Djarin arrived in Mos Eisley looking for repairs 
            to his ship, the Razor Crest, and took a job with Toro Calican to hunt Fennec Shand. Toro shot her and 
            left her for dead on the sands of Tatooine.</p>
        <p>Shortly after, Boba Fett found her, and took her to a mod-parlor, where a modifier saved her life. Djarin later 
            returned to Mos Eisley in in search of a Mandolorian to help him, and proceeded to Mos Pelgo, where he met Cobb 
            Vanth. He later returned to the city, and was introduced to "Frog Lady" by Peli, who said she might know where to 
            find Mandalorians. After the destruction of the Razor Crest, Djarin returned to Peli again, and she helped him to 
            modify an N-1 starfighter.</p>
